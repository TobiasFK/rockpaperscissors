        Rock Paper Scissors:
        
        first we need to get the player's choice by asking for input
        It needs to be case-insensitive

        then we need to create a way to get the computer's choice
        it needs to return either rock, paper or scissors randomly

        


        then we need to create a round of Rock Paper scissor
        it should take the player's choice and the computer's choice
            IF player's choice is scissors AND computer's choice is paper, then player wins.
            IF player's choice is rock AND computer's choice is scissors, then player wins
            IF player's choice is paper AND computer's choice is rock, then player wins
            ELSE computer wins

        For all of the results, it needs to return a message that tells the player whether he won or lost and why, e.g. "You lose! Paper beats rock"

        To play a full game (5 rounds) of rock paper scissor, we should then create a way to repeat the round of rock paper scissor 5 times and then stop

        then we need to print out the results of that to the player
